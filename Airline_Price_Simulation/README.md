# ✈️ Airline Price Simulation

This project simulates airline ticket prices over time using Python. It models demand, seasonal variation, and route-based pricing behavior to identify trends and optimal purchase windows.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Simulates dynamic pricing for multiple routes
- Models high-demand vs low-demand scenarios
- Visualizes pricing trends over simulated timeframes
- Explores consumer vs airline pricing advantage zones

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 File
- `airline_price_simulation.ipynb` – Main notebook with all code, logic, and visualizations

## 📈 Sample Output
*Open the notebook to view all simulated price trend graphs and analysis.*
