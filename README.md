# Databricks
Hey there! This is a repository of all my databricks work on college projects, using Python and SQL languages. 
Some large files need to be downloaded and viewed, but the rest of the codes are available on GitHub itself. 
Hope my work can help beginners in databricks to navigate better. Happy exploring!
